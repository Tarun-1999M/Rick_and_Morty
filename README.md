# Ask Rick a Question - Rick and Morty Dialogue Bot

![Rick](https://huggingface.co/spaces/course-demos/Rick_and_Morty_QA/resolve/main/rick.png)

This project is a fun and interactive bot that generates responses based on Rick and Morty dialogues. Powered by Hugging Face's `transformers` library, this bot allows you to ask Rick anything and get a response that feels true to the character.

## Overview

The bot was trained to answer questions using dialogue from the show "Rick and Morty". It utilizes the Hugging Face pipeline for text generation to simulate Rick's responses. This project is built using Gradio for a user-friendly interface.

## Demo

You can interact with the live demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tarun-1999M/Rick_and_Morty).

## How It Works

The interface is built using Gradio, and it allows users to input any prompt they like. The model then generates a response based on the input, trying to stay true to Rick's personality and the overall theme of "Rick and Morty".

## Features
